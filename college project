This project uses MATLAB, a programming tool, to recognize Braille writing. Braille is a tactile writing system for the visually impaired. 
Image processing techniques are employed to convert images of Braille characters into readable text.
The goal is to help blind individuals read text written in Braille more easily. 
Students will learn how to apply digital image processing algorithms to analyze and interpret Braille dots, ultimately making Braille text accessible to the visually impaired. 
It's a meaningful project that combines technology and empathy for those with visual disabilities.
